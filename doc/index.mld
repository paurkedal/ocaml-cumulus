{0 Cumulus}

{1 Synopsis}

Cumulus defines a signal-like type, which facilitates differential updates
of the underlying value. When a cumulus signal is changed, it emits a patch
along with the new value, allowing consumers to integrate it into their
existing state rather than reconstructing from the new value alone. Cumulus
is based on the {{:http://erratique.ch/software/react} React} FRP library.
